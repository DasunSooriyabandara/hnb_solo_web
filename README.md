<p>This is an attempt to automate the HNB Solo application’s happy path as part of my self-study in automation testing. I’ve included all the necessary details related to the testing process and an Allure report for reference. If there are areas where I can improve, I would greatly appreciate any feedback or suggestions to enhance my knowledge and skills.</p>
